## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Model 1  
A. The training and validation losses are decreasing which shows there are no hidden errors in the model 
B. The train accuracy is away from validation accuracy, which shows the model is overfitting 
C. The Validation accuracy is low, we need to retry with proper preprosing techniques to learn efficiently
- Model 2
A. The training and validation losses are decreasing which shows there are no hidden errors in the model
B. The train and validation accuracy are comparable, which means the model is not overfitting and is generalized.
C. The validation accuracy has increased from model 1 , which is 0.2067 .

- Model 3
A. The training and validation losses are decreasing which shows there are no hidden errors in the model .
B. The train accuracy is increasing with the number of epochs The validation accuracy is 0.111
